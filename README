Tools for snappers for working with git and stuff

guppy
-----

Does a pull from upstream master and push to origin master. You can be in a
branch with uncommitted work; your stuff will be safely stashed/unstashed and
you will be automatically switched to master for the pull/push and back again
when done.

Will exit with a warning if the pull into your master branch requires a merge;
you should be doing all work in topic branches so that your master branch can
do fast-forward-only pulls.
